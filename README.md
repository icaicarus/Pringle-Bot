# Pringle-Bot
Using hikari paired with hikari lightbulb, I attempted to create a Discord bot named *Pringle bot* that reads chat input and responds with different pre-determined messages and images. Most of the features are for testing, as it was my first time working with chat bots and hikari libraries.
