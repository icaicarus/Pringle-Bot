# Pringle-Bot
Using hikari paired with hikari lightbulb, I attempted to create a Discord bot named *Pringle bot* that reads chat input and responds with different pre-determined messages and images. These are based on a friend's usual repsonses to texts. Most of the features are for testing, as it was my first time working with chat bots and hikari libraries. 
## Slash commands
- **/willow** : Sends a random picture of Willow the dog
- **/leroy** : Sends a random picture of Leroy the cat
- **/creature** : Responds with a random sea creature fact
## Libraries
Following the tutorials by [Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/@Lucas-tz3jp "@Lucas-tz3jp") on YouTube, I installed the following libraries:
- **[Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari)** : An opinionated, static typed Discord microframework for Python3 and asyncio that supports Discord's v10 REST and Gateway APIs
- **[Lightbulb](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb)** : An easy to use command handler library that integrates with the Discord API wrapper library for Python, Hikari
Other libraries include dotenv for cloaking sesnitive information.
> Note: *Pringle bot* is not available for installation as of right now.
